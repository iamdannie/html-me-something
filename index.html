                <p>It said that a lot of girls go undiagnosed with adhd because they tend not to fit in that box they that they want is labled ADHD. There are undiagnosed women that may live their whole lives being called ditzy, lazy, spacey, too chatty or dumb. I feel this is unacceptable and it is critical that people understand what ADHD often look like in girls and women. </p>

                <h2>A Day In My Shoes</h2>
                <p>My day start out good. I will make a list, write in my calender, put reminder in my phone with like five alerts and lastly a to do list. Now for example cleaning my space means spending 3 hours organizing my dresser drawers, and then become exhausted and retire to watch Netflix. Meanwhile I might sitting there I forgot that I left the clothes in the washer and they have to be rewashed because I forgot about my reminders</p>
